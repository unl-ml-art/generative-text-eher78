## Abstract

<!-- Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions. -->

Within the history of exhibitions and galleries, museum labels are a vital piece of information to describe the name of an artist, the description of the artwork, and the inspiration behind certain pieces of creative media. The human thought process to add descriptions to an artwork is relatively based on the collaboration between the artist and perhaps a human "descriptor". I am interested in seeing whether or not a generative network can recreate the human thought process of creating museum labels of artworks. This project will be done by taking existing descriptions from the [Sheldon Museum of Art](https://sheldonartmuseum.org/) as data and creating generated descriptions from the dataset. Results will be evaluated based on descriptions, grammar, puncuation, and examining the comparisons between a original museum label and the generated label.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
