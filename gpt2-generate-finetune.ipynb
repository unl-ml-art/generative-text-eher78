      "\"Black Skin, Blue Masks\" (1957), from the Munk T.I.H. book Series of Hive Minds\n",
      "In 1957, Dr. F.A. Hayek gave a talk at the Munk School of International Studies in Seattle in which \n",
      "he described a number of theoretical developments that had helped shape his thinking about international affairs in the \n",
      "future. In particular, Hayek introduced a discussion about \"vertically compressed perspective\". In this perspective, \n",

      "in view. The other half of the visible image is obscured. Instead of\n",
      "seeing a single, prominent object as it appears in the daytime to an observer standing on \n",
      "3o the horizon, for example, the Visible Man 1 sees a group of objects in concert. The objects intermingle to form \n",
      "a complex web of movement, enabling the mind to focus on a single object more easily.\n",
      "The use of vertically compressed perspective in Hayek's description of a style of visual art \n",
      "making has a number important implications for the study of the practice. First, it clearly \n",
      "means what it says about the artists and/or craftspeople who embraced vertically compressed \n",
      "perception that they applied the insight to their own craft. Second, it shows that the \n",
      "idea spread rapidly among artists and artists sought to incorporate it into their practices. \n",
      "In particular, David Mamet's use of the technique can be broadly explained as a response to \n",
      "Hayek's work and Hayek's own experimentation with the formal approach to artmaking. While \n",
      "meeting with Mamet to discuss Mamet's paintings, Hayek had introduced vertically compressed \n",
      "perceptions to Mamet's work for the previous issue of Gallery & Frame. During \n",
      "their subsequent discussion, however, Hayek suggested that the process be extended to the work he \n",
      "was preparing for the magazine. Instead of presenting his work in abstract form, Hayek would \n",
      "insert a vertically extending head or masking tape into the center of a work of art, and the \n",
      "head would permanently anchor the work to the viewer's head. From this initial \n",
      "position, the viewer moved through the workshapes of figures, bowls, and other art \n",
      "form elements, eventually resting when and where the view to the head no longer required the \n",
      "person looking to make a movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In exploring the use of vertically compressed perspectives in art, Hayek's exhibitionists did not \n",
      "only ignore the formal rules of artmaking—they also contradicted them. They were rejecting \n",
      "the very basis of what they were trying to achieve. They were breaking with the formal norms \n",
      "of artmaking, rejecting what Hayek saw as its centrality as well as the limits of what it \n",
      "could achieve through formal means.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways, then, vertically compressed perspectives mark the beginning of a modern movement in art \n",

    "* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n",
    "* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",
